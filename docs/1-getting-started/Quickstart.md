## If you want to know IOST basic concepts

Before you get into IOST technical details or developing smart contract on IOST, it is helpful to know IOST basic concepts at first and have a thorough understanding about IOST. You can learn some basic concepts about IOST's [features and performance](2-intro-of-iost/Features-and-performance.md), [infrastructure](2-intro-of-iost/Infra.md), [economic model](2-intro-of-iost/Economic-model.md), and [community operations](2-intro-of-iost/Community-operations.md). You can always refer to the [glossary](6-reference/Glossary.md) if you come accross some terms you don't understand.

You will be able to understand the internal logic of IOST through these documentations.

## If you want to use IOST and join community

You can join IOST community and contribute to IOST daily operation even if you are *NOT* a developer. You should understand the [account system](2-intro-of-iost/Account.md) so that you can manage your account on IOST properly.

## If you are a developer

For developers, there're a lot of materials to help you.

### Run and play with IOST

You can choose to [run local single-node net](3-running-iost-node/LocalServer.md) or [join IOST net](3-running-iost-node/Deployment.md). You can use [command line tool](3-running-iost-node/iWallet.md) to play with IOST Blockchain.

### Smart contracts developing

For smart contract developers, you can refer to [smart contract developing sections](4-smart-contract/ContractStart.md) for details. There's also a step-by-step [realworld example](4-smart-contract/LuckyBet.md) provided for smart contract developers. It introduces how to write/deploy/run contracts.

There're also some contract provided by IOST you can get use of, you can find details about them in [these sections](5-built-in-contracts/EconContract.md). You can also refer to [gas charge table](6-reference/GasChargeTable.md) to estimate contract running costs.

### SDK and API

There are also SDK and API provided for developers:
* Javascript SDK
	* [Source code on Github](https://github.com/iost-official/iost.js)
	* Documentation on [IOST](7-iost-js/IOST-class.md), [blockchain](7-iost-js/Blockchain-class.md), [keypair](7-iost-js/KeyPair-class.md), and [transaction](7-iost-js/Transaction-class.md)
* JSON RPC API
	* [Documentation](6-reference/API.md)
