Currently, IOST smart contracts programming depends on [Go-IOS-Protocol](https://github.com/iost-official/Go-IOS-Protocol).

In the future, IOST will become independent of GO-IOS-Protocol.

Developers needs to clone the entire branch:

```git
git clone https://github.com/iost-official/Go-IOS-Protocol.git
```

Then, install `node` and `npm` in the directory `Go-IOS-Protocol/cmd/playground/contract`.

## Installing ```Node```

Please refer to [Official Documents](https://nodejs.org/zh-cn/download/package-manager/#macos)

## Installing```npm```

```git
cd Go-IOS-Protocol/cmd/playground/contract
npm install
```
